Add ref/unref here too
Add constraints to properties, this way we can define enums and ranges
Given the nature of ender, it is very easy to describe any kind of object (not only renderers) with the current approach. It will be useful for example 
on esvg, where there are several objects that are not a renderable but do need to set/get/animate properties. The only problem with this is the single
inheritance we have now, on SVG every object inherits from the SVGElement both the renderables and the not renderables, so we'll need to duplicate
the attributes on both abstractions we do on esvg (one for the renderables and one for the objects)
