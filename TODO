Ender:

+ Make every call to a function return an Eina_Error, this way we can make every binding
  handle execeptions easily
+ Add bindings for ender
+ Add mutation events per property
+ Add a serializer
+ Add ref/unref here too
+ Add constraints to properties, this way we can define enums and ranges
+ Make every function that sets user provided data also receive a callback to free it

Escen:
+ Add an "external" type. So escen instead of creating the element, you'll need to pass it and then escen will animate it
+ Fix the examples and add more eye-candy ones
+ Move some of the examples to the test dir to have a simple way to test the different renderer spans functions
+ We'll need to modify the benchmark to render every ender found
+ Append T_ to every token to avoid namespace collisions
